							<p>
							As I am watching the second impeachment trial of Former President Trump,
							I can not help but feel apathetic about the future.
							Republican senators are skipping the trial, reading books, 
							not even giving the slightest of attention to the impeachment managers.
							While not all of them are -- I'm sure a few of them have respect -- 
							it is still a regretful sight to see.
							What kind of world do we live in where these "representatives"
							can just walk out and ignore the facts?
							It is a world burdened by the ignorance of truth.
							</p>
							<p>
							I do not intend to focus on politics throughout this article, 
							but it is important to mention as these are the people who can fix this.
							I also do not intend to bring hate to any particular group of people.
							Please understand that this is an opinion piece.
