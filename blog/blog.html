							As I am watching the second impeachment trial of Former President Trump,
							I can not help but feel apathetic about the future.
							Republican senators are skipping the trial, reading books, 
							not even giving the slightest of attention to the impeachment managers.
							While not all of them are -- I'm sure a few of them have respect -- 
							it is still a regretful sight to see.
							What kind of world do we live in where these "representatives"
							can just walk out and ignore the facts?
							It is a world burdened by the ignorance of truth.
							</p>
							<p>
							I do not intend to focus on politics throughout this article, 
							but it is important to mention as these are the people who can fix this.
							I also do not intend to bring hate to any particular group of people
							nor do I wish to come off as pretentious.
							Please understand that this is an opinion piece.
							</p>
							<p>
							Life has become a compilation of temporary experiences.
							Millions deathscrolling through whatever social media they feel like,
							looking at memes they probably do not even find funny anymore.
							Many of these memes portray real-life events which results in a mixture of news and entertainment.
							This combination has been around for decades in the form of tabloids,
							but now it seems ever more prevalent.
							News anchors have become celebrities, combining factual reporting with a personal take.
							Everyday, the Don Lemons and Sean Hannitys of the mainstream media
							write their piece on that day's 24-hour news cycle.
							I am not saying that objectivity has been lost, but it is damn close.
							The internet has made it difficult to discern fact from fiction.
							Misinformation is easily spread across Facebook, Twitter, or any information outlet.
							Who does the modern man trust in the 2020s? He trusts those who agree with him.
							</p>
							<p>
							It is only natural for humans to flock to those who think alike.
							However, the effect of the echo chamber can become overpowering.
							When one man is able to shout the same lie repeatedly,
							and trick those who would otherwise stay peaceful to assault their fellow man,
							that is the moment the institution of truth falls.
							The quelling of speech and the implementation of wrongthink lead to de facto authoritarianism.
							When everyone agrees with each other or are too afraid to speak their mind during a disagreement,
							is that not the same as there being just one person?
							</p>
							<p>
							Digital society ensures a culture of half-truths.
							People are obfuscating their true thoughts to protect themselves and others from conflict.
							Take for example the influence of cancel culture.
							While anyone who says racial slur should be discredited,
							those who simply hold a different opinion than what is in the accepted spectrum
							are ousted in an effort to preserve peace. 
							The sectionalism as George Washington described in his farewell address
							is the virus that will kill America.
							</p>
							<p>
							The tribes of thought which people are finding themselves in
							limits the ideological diversity which has benefited America since its beginning.
							Whenever someone of the opposing tribe is presented with factual evidence that disproves their argument,
							they cry "Heresy!" and retreat back into their weak state of mind.
							They are unwilling to accept the truth because it would erase what they have believed in their entire life.
							This is similar to Plato's Allegory of Cave which describes a group of people chained in a cave
							where they can only see shadows on a wall.
							Once let free, they quickly are struck with the bright light of the world outside the cave
							and run back to their cave.
							The bright light had damaged their vision, and they can no longer see the shadows on the wall.
							Knowing this, they never venture out again, stuck in their previous ways.
