						<p>I will post my weekly watchlist here every sunday.</p>
						<div class="crypto-watch">
							<p>Week March 29 - April 2</p>
							<h3>I am watching:</h3>
							<div id="first-watch">
								<h3>1. XMR</h3>
								<p>Monero is the only real cryptocurrency.<br>
								This will be the coin people will use in the future if they want to stay anonymous.<br>
								With atomic swaps on the way, more and more people will use XMR.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="second-watch">
								<h3>2. HBAR</h3>
								<p>Hedera Hashgraph is seeing huge rates of adoption.<br>
								It is technically not even a blockchain.<br>
								HBAR just about to break above it ATH--looking bullish.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="third-watch">
								<h3>3. SNX</h3>
								<p>Synthetix will be one of the biggest players in DeFi.<br>
								As crypto gets bigger, derivatives will be more wanted.<br>
								Institutions will pick this coin over others, guarenteed.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="fourth-watch">
								<h3>4. BAT</h3>
								<p>Basic Attention Token has very recently mooned.<br>
								The Brave Browser is seeing more users every month.<br>
								This coin is sure to go up.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="fifth-watch">
								<h3>5. BDP</h3>
								<p>Big Data Protocol is my moonshot for the week.<br>
								This coin is somewhat like OCEAN.<br>
								Institutions seem to be buying this one as well.</p>

						<div id="second-watch">
							<h3>2. RBLX</h3>
							<p>Roblox is a recent IPO.<br>
							I do not even know why kids play this game.<br>
							Jim Cramer says it is good, but who trusts that guy?<p>
						</div>
						<div id="third-watch">
							<h3>3. TSLA</h3>
							<p>The obvious Tesla plug. Its 31% down form its ATH.<br>
							I keep seeing more of their cars on the road each week.<br>
							Buy the dip.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="fourth-watch">
							<h3>4. NVDA</h3>
							<p>Why are GPUs even still expensive?<br>
							The mining driver for the RTX 3060 got "leaked" so miners are happy.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="fifth-watch">
							<h3>5. PLUG</h3>
							<p>I was right, it was in a bubble.<br>
							Might still be a good buy, but be sure to wait till it bottoms.</p>
