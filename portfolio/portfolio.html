						<h2>Crypto Watchlist</h2>
						<p>I will post my weekly watchlist here every sunday.</p>
						<div class="crypto-watch">
							<p>Week February 15 - 19</p>
							<h3>I am watching:</h3>
							<div id="first-watch">
								<h3>1. XMR</h3>
								<p>Monero is the only real cryptocurrency.<br>
								This will be the coin people will use in the future if they want to stay anonymous.<br>
								Went up a lot last week, but still has a lot of room to grow.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="second-watch">
								<h3>2. ADA</h3>
								<p>Cardano was the first proof-of-stake crypto.<br>
								It is one of the biggest competitors with Ethereum.<br>
								However, Ethereum is working fast to upgrade to proof-of-stake.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="third-watch">
								<h3>3. DOT</h3>
								<p>Polkadot is the other big competitor with ethereum.<br>
								It is close to overtaking Cardano.<br>
								Launched earlier in 2020, most likely has more room to grow than ADA.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="fourth-watch">
								<h3>4. GRT</h3>
								<p>The Graph is a recently launched network on the Ethereum blockchain.<br>
								As the crypto market grows, more people will want to access the data on it.<br>
								More than doubled last week, so be wary about buying right now.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="fifth-watch">
								<h3>5. DOGE</h3>
								<p>Dogecoin is a shitcoin being pumped by Elon Musk.<br>
								The price of this coin can only go down on the long term.<br>
								Do not believe the lies, it will never go to a dollar.<p>

						<p>Week February 15 - 19</p>
						<h3>I am watching:</h3>
						<div id="first-watch">
							<h3>1. GME</h3>
							<p>Will be interesting to see what WSB still has in them.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="second-watch">
							<h3>2. PLUG</h3>
							<p>Bought this at $2.75 and sold at $9, it's now at $63.<br>
							It has been consolidating at around $60-70 since January.<br>
							The 1Y chart looks like a bubble, but who knows.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="third-watch">
							<h3>3. TSLA</h3>
							<p>The obvious Tesla plug. Last week it went down 6.6%.<br>
							Tesla is beating every competitor in their market.<br>
							Literally can not go tits up.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="fourth-watch">
							<h3>4. NVDA</h3>
							<p>The GPU market is going crazy. Only the GTX 1050 TI is not being scalped.<br>
							Nvidia went up 7.5% last week, seemingly correlating with the crypto market.<br>
							Every crypto miner is buying their GPUs; the company is winning.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="fifth-watch">
							<h3>5. AMD</h3>
							<p>I've always been a fan of AMD since they revealed their Ryzen line up.<br>
							The 3000x and 5000x series are sold out due to the same problem affecting Nvidia.<br>
							They've beat Intel in the CPU sphere, definitely a good buy.</p>
